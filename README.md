# BeeSmart
### Real time sensor data from the beehive to beekeeper.

BeeSmart is a smart connected device made to empower beekeepers with seamless remote monitoring of beehive health. BeeSmart is outfitted with four 50kg load sensors that accurately measure beehive weight. Additionally, it features two weather resistant temperature probes, providing beekeepers with the flexibility to insert them directly into their beehives at the specific locations of their choosing. BeeSmart is powered by the Arduino MKR 1010, serving as the brains of the device. It seamlessly interfaces with these sensors, capturing vital beehive data in real-time and integrating the data with the MathWorks ThingSpeak API. This allows valuable information to be effortlessly stored and presented in visually captivating displays for beekeepers on the BeeSmart dashboard. The Arduino Code is contained under the hiveMind directory for this project.

The report provided in the report directory of this project will describe the development, experimental setup and evaluation of the device built for this project and provide a conclusion that evaluates the performance of the device while discussing possible future work that could be done to further enhance this project in the next generations of the device.

I encourage any and all beekeepers to help contribute to this project and to read the report to follow the process to create your own BeeSmart device.
